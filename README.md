# GitHub Profile & Engagement Analyzer Web App

## üöÄ Project Overview

The **GitHub Profile & Engagement Analyzer** is a powerful and interactive web application designed to provide comprehensive insights into any public GitHub user's profile and their repositories. Beyond standard GitHub statistics, this tool introduces unique metrics like a custom **Engagement Score** and visualizes a developer's most used programming languages, all presented through a modern, "coder-friendly" web interface.

This application is built with Python (Flask) on the backend, interacting with the GitHub REST API, and a dynamic frontend utilizing HTML, CSS, and locally-served Bootstrap.

    -   Description, creation, update, and push dates.
    -   Open issues count (including Pull Requests).
    -   Forks, stars, and watchers.
    -   License and topics.
    -   A list of top contributors and their commit counts.
-   **üñ•Ô∏è Modern Web Interface:** A sleek, dark-themed, and responsive design with a "coder/developer" aesthetic, providing an intuitive user experience. All main sections are visible on a single page, with longer lists being scrollable within their containers.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up and run the GitHub Profile & Engagement Analyzer locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

-   **Python 3.7 or higher:**
    -   Download from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
    -   **Important:** During installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".
-   **Git:**
    -   Download from [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and clone this project:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/OmprakashSahani/GitHub-Profile-And-Engagement-Analyzer-Web-App.git](https://github.com/OmprakashSahani/GitHub-Profile-And-Engagement-Analyzer-Web-App.git) # Replace with your actual repo URL
cd GitHub-Profile-And-Engagement-Analyzer-Web-App
````

### Step 2: Set up a Python Virtual Environment

A virtual environment is crucial for managing project dependencies, preventing conflicts with other Python projects or your system's global Python installation.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows (PowerShell in VS Code Terminal or Git Bash):
.\venv\Scripts\Activate
# On macOS/Linux/Git Bash:
source venv/bin/activate
```

You will know the virtual environment is active when you see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

  * **Troubleshooting Activation on Windows (PowerShell):** If you encounter an error like "running scripts is disabled on this system," you might need to change your PowerShell Execution Policy.
    1.  Open **PowerShell as Administrator** (search for PowerShell, right-click, select "Run as administrator").
    2.  Run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
    3.  Type `Y` and press Enter to confirm.
    4.  Close the Administrator PowerShell and try activating the `venv` again in your regular terminal.

### Step 3: Install Python Dependencies

With your virtual environment active, install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install Flask requests
```

### Step 4: GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) Setup

To allow the application to make authenticated requests to the GitHub API (which provides higher rate limits and access to more data like user's own private repos if given permissions), you need a Personal Access Token.

1.  **Generate Your PAT:**

      - Log in to your GitHub account.
      - Go to your GitHub Settings: [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
      - Click on **"Generate new token (classic)"**.
      - Provide a descriptive **Note** for your token (e.g., `GitHub Analyzer Web App`).
      - Set an **Expiration** date (e.g., 30 days, 90 days, or "No expiration" for development convenience, but consider security for longer terms).
      - **Select the necessary scopes (permissions) for the token:**
          - Under the `repo` section, check `public_repo` (Allows read access to public repositories).
          - Under the `user` section, check `read:user` (Allows read access to user profile data).
      - Click the **"Generate token"** button at the bottom.
      - **CRITICAL: Immediately copy the displayed token string\!** This is the **only time** GitHub will show you the full token. If you lose it, you'll have to generate a new one.

2.  **Set the PAT as an Environment Variable:**
    Your Flask application reads the PAT from an environment variable named `GITHUB_TOKEN`. **You must set this variable in your terminal session *before* running the Flask application.**

      - **On Windows (PowerShell in VS Code Terminal or Git Bash):**
        ```powershell
        $env:GITHUB_TOKEN="YOUR_ACTUAL_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE"
        ```
      - **On macOS/Linux/Git Bash:**
        ```bash
        export GITHUB_TOKEN="YOUR_ACTUAL_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE"
        ```

    (Remember to replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE` with the token you copied from GitHub.)

### Step 5: Download & Serve Bootstrap/Popper.js Locally

To ensure the web interface's design loads correctly and to avoid potential Subresource Integrity (SRI) issues or reliance on external CDNs during development, Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript files are served directly by your Flask application. These files are already referenced in `templates/index.html` via `url_for('static', filename='...')`.

You need to download these files once and place them in the `static/` folder:

1.  Navigate into the `static` folder within your project:
    ```bash
    cd static
    ```
2.  Download the following minified files and save them directly into this `static/` folder:
      - `bootstrap.min.css`: [https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap%405.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css)
      - `bootstrap.min.js`: [https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js)
      - `popper.min.js`: [https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.11.8/dist/umd/popper.min.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@popperjs/core@2.11.8/dist/umd/popper.min.js)
3.  After downloading, navigate back to the root of your project:
    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

### Step 6: Run the Flask Application

With your virtual environment active and the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable set, you can now start the Flask development server:

```bash
python app.py
```

You should see output in your terminal similar to:
`* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)`

### Step 7: Access the Web Interface

Open your web browser and navigate to the address provided by Flask, which is typically:

```
[http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
```

Now, enter any public GitHub username (e.g., `octocat`, `torvalds`, or your own: `OmprakashSahani`) in the input field and click "Analyze Profile" to see the magic happen\!

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

This project can be further expanded with exciting new features:

  - **Interactive Data Visualizations:** Integrate JavaScript charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js) to create dynamic graphs for language distribution, contribution trends, or follower growth.
  - **User Authentication (OAuth):** Allow users to log in directly with their GitHub accounts to analyze private repositories (with appropriate permissions) and manage their own data within the app.
  - **Advanced Repository Metrics:** Implement analysis of pull request and issue statistics (e.g., average time to close issues, most active contributors by lines of code).
  - **Historical Data Tracking:** Store and display historical data for profiles/repositories to show trends over time.
  - **Deployment to Cloud Platform:** Host the application on a public cloud service (e.g., Google Cloud Platform, Heroku, Vercel) for wider accessibility.
  - **Cross-Profile Comparison:** Add functionality to compare metrics of two different GitHub profiles side-by-side.
  - **Optimized API Usage:** Implement more robust pagination handling for users with thousands of repositories/followers and explore GitHub GraphQL API for more efficient data fetching.
